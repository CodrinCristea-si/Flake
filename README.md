# Flake

**Flake** is a social network application prototype created by a small team of developers. Similar to other related applications, **Flake** has many functionalities:
  - ``User Profile`` -> username, first name, last name, location, occupation, date of birth, a user can search for another user by using its username.
  - ``User Login and Registration`` -> a user can login, create an account or logout.
  - ``User Relationships (Friendship)`` -> a user can send a friend request, unfriend with a user, check for friendship status (eg. for how long two users are friends).
  - ``User Messaging`` -> a user can send a message to a specific user (if there is a friendship between these two users), reply to a message, check the previous conversation, and send a message to many users at once (group messege).
  - ``User Events`` -> a user can create an event (with a specific description) that other users can join at a certain location and time, other users can participate to events and can be notified when an event is approching, a user can check or edit its own events.
  - ``User Statistics`` -> a user can generate reports regarding the new relationships created in a specific period of time or the messages between two users in a spcific time interval, these reports can be exported as ``.pdf`` files. 

# Technologies
**Flaske** has been developed using ``Java 17`` mostly. Besides that, other technologies or frameworks have been used such as:
  - ``JavaFX``: used for the Graphical User Interface infrastructure.
  - ``CSS``: used to style ``JavaFX`` GUI elements and pictures.
